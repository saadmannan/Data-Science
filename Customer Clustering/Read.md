#Clustering-of-Customers Based on K-Means Clustering Algorithm

Analyzing the content of an E-commerce dataset that lists purchases made by 4339 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09) and group them based on the purchases they made. Based on this analysis, I have developed a clustering model that allows to cluster the customers based on their purchases.

#K-Means Clustering Introduction:
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). The goal of this algorithm is to find groups(clusters) in the data and will find the number of groups(K) using Elbow method. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.
